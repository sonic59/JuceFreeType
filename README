Android has poor font support. There is no way to install OS wide fonts. There is no font enumeration API. It is not possible to iterate a Path to get glyph outlines.

By using FreeType we can completely bypass the Android font system resulting in better support for fonts.

This repo improves upon the last (JuceAndroidFonts) by merging all the FreeType code into a single file used both by the Linux and Android platforms.
This repo contains it's own copy of Juce as well as the default GUI project out of Introjucer.
